If you work with data and you must make changes to it, it is advisable to leave a trace of what is done,
many times the data manipulation is done from Excel, making it difficult to modify the control of the process
and increasing the risk of error, in addition to high costs. in processing time and worst... where blue screen or pc reboot becomes frequent :- (

 For example, if you have a process where you need to change the structure from the original data, and you need to filter, remove data 
 based on specific conditions, sort the file based on a date or other field, add variables, change formats, extract two data 
 from a field and build new variables etcâ€¦ so those must be executed at the program level in a structured way and the Python
 tool allows successfully executing these processes and more. Not only do you save time in the execution of this type of process, 
 but the risk of error will decrease by 100%. You will have total control in addition to learning a new technological tool.
We will see an example where we will use Python to transform and modify different sources that must finally be joined as input
in the construction of a Dashboard.
